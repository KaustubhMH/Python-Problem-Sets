# Class Problem Sets

1. Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. 
Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they 
will turn 100 years old.

```
	#input:
	Enter Name: Arya Stark
	Enter Age: 16
	
	#output:
	Hey Arya! You’ll turn 100 years old in 2101
```

2. Write a program that prints out all the elements of the 
list that are less than 5.

```
	#input:
	[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

	#output:
	[1, 1, 2, 3] 
```

3. Write a program that takes a list and returns a new list that 
contains all the elements of the first list minus all the duplicates.

```
	#input:
	[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 64, 35, 93, 35, 87, 4, 3]

	#output:
	[1, 2, 3, 4, 64, 35, 93, 87]
```

4. Write a program that asks the user for a phrase/sentence. 
Print back to the user the same string, except with the words in
backwards order. For example,

```
	#input:
	Winter is here
	
	#output:
	Here is winter
```

5. Given a element, search the entire list for the element and return 
the indices that match the list.

```
	#input:
	[1, 2, 3, 2, 0, 65, 21, 4, 2, 10]
	Search Element: 2

	#output:
	[1, 3, 8]
```

6. Write a script that asks for users’ Name and USN as an input and saves
it in a Dictionary with USN as the key and Name as the value. Take 3 entries 
from the user before printing the dictionary.

```
	#input:
	Enter Name: Arya Stark
	Enter USN: 1SJ15EC001

	Enter Name: Jon Snow
	Enter USN: 1SJ15EC045

	Enter Name: Cersei Lannister
	Enter USN: 1SJ15EC036

	#output:
	{ ‘1SJ15EC001’ : “Arya Stark” ,
	  ‘1SJ15EC045’ : “Jon Snow” ,
	  ‘1SJ15EC036’ : “Cersei Lannister” }
```
